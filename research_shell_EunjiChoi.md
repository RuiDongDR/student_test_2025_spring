## **The Impact of Employment Status on Depression Among Older Adults**


### **Objectives**

- This study aimed to examine the potential impact of employment status on depression among older adults, in response to the increasing proportion of older individuals in the population and the rising trend of delayed legal retirement age.

### **Background**

- The U.S. Census Bureau projects that *<ins>by 2034, the number of older adults will surpass the number of the younger population</ins>* . This demographic shift is expected to result in a decline in workforce participation while increasing the number of individuals dependent on Social Security. In response, experts are examining the implications of this trend on both labor markets and pension systems. To address these challenges, *<ins>the United States</ins>*, along with countries such as Greece, France, and the United Kingdom, *<ins>has raised the legal retirement age</ins>*.

- Despite these policy changes, limited research exists on the effects of delayed retirement on the health of older adults. In the U.S., the full retirement age varies based on birth year; for instance, individuals born in 1958 reach full retirement at 66, whereas those born in 1960 or later do so at 67. As older adults are expected to remain in the workforce for extended periods, it is **crucial to investigate the potential impact of prolonged employment on their health and well-being**.

- This study utilized data from the 2022 Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD) (n=710,964), collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

- In the graph above, the **red line** represents **the depression rate** across age groups, while the **blue bars** indicate **unemployment percentages**.
- At first glance, the urgency of addressing depression among older adults may be overlooked, as its prevalence appears lower than in other age groups.
- The graph may suggest that higher unemployment correlates with lower depression rates and that depression decreases with age.
- However, this correlation may be misleading. Depression among older adults remains significant, with 1,534 cases per 100,000 individuals. Given the varying life stages, resources, and cultural factors across age groups, a more detailed analysis of employment status among those 65 and older is essential to better understand its impact on depression.

Among those who reported having depression, only 7% were employed, while 92.35% were unemployed. This suggests that ***unemployment could potenitally be associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing depression***

### **Conclusion**
A potential association between employment status and the well-being of older adults is suggested. However, limitations prevent establishing causality. Further research with a more robust and representative sample is needed for a clearer understanding.
